% This script is a wrapper for findROIboundaries and makeFaceVertexCData so
% that they smoothly work together and you don't have to spend a lot of
% your own time making them work together. The code sets up the basics of
% the patch object

% Inputs:
%
% surface = a structure with two fields: vertices (the vertices making up 
% the surface) and faces (the faces of the surface)
%
% vertex_id = the roi id of each vertex
%
% data = either data for each individual roi or data for each vertex.
% If you don't want any data to be displayed for a roi or vertex, set that
% value to NaN. Note that this assumes a roi with a vertex_id has no data
% to plot. Additionally, if the vertex_ids are non sequential (e.g., like
% what you get from an .annot file) then data can take the form of a ROI*2
% matrix, where ROI is the number of regions, each row is a particular 
% region with the first column being the data to plot and the second being
% the region ID (should correspond to what is in vertex_id)
%
% boundary_method = 'faces', 'midpoint', 'centroid', 'edge_vertices', or 
% 'edge_faces'. 'faces' will find the faces which exist between ROIs and
% those will be coloured black to specify the boundary. 'midpoint' finds 
% the edges that connect the vertices of two different ROIs and takes the
% midpoint of the edge and uses those coordinates to define the boundary. 
% 'centroid' finds the faces which exist between ROIs and uses the centroid
% of those to draw the coordinates that define the boundary. 
% 'edge_vertices' finds the vertices which define the boundary of the ROI 
% and uses them for the coordinates. 'edge_faces' finds the edges along
% faces which make up the boundary and uses them for the coordinates
%
% cmap = an N*3 matrix specifying the RGB values making up the colormap to
% use
%
% linewidth = the width of the boundary when using 'midpoint', or 
% 'centroid'.
%
% climits = the range to apply the colormap. This will work perfectly fine
% if the range specified is larger than the data itself or if the upper
% limit is larger. However if the lower limit is larger than the smallest
% value in data, then it may get strange. If colorUnknownGrey = 1, then
% faces/vertices with a value smaller than the limit will be coloured grey,
% or potentially black if 'faces' is used. If it is set to 0 and 'faces' is
% used, those regions will be set to black while if 'centroid' or midpoint' 
% are selected, the colormap will work appropriately). So if you really 
% need to enforce a lower limit I would suggest threshold the data in 
% advance and all should be good.
%
% Outputs:
%
% p = the patch surface object
%
% boundary_plot = a strcture containing a line object defining each
% boundary
%
% BOUNDARY = the boundary of the rois. For 'faces' this will be a logical
% where a value of 1 indicates that face is on the boundary between ROIs.
% For 'midpoint', 'centroid' or 'edges', BOUNDARY will be a cell where each 
% element contains the coordinates of the points making up the boundary, 
% which can be plotted as a line. Note that each boundary defines a 
% continuous ROI, if a ROI is made up of multiple non-continuous parts 
% (i.e., the ROI is made up of multiple unconnected sections), there will 
% be a boundary for each of those parts
