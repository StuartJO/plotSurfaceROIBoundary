function [BOUNDARY,BOUNDARY_ROI_ID,ROI_COMPONENTS,BOUNDARY_VERTS] = findROIboundaries(vertices,faces,vertex_id,boundary_method)

% This script will plot the boundaries defined by some parcellation/ROIS on
% a surface projection. It can also alter the colormap so regions that do
% not have any information are coloured grey.
%
% Inputs:
%
% vertices = the vertices making up the surface
%
% faces = the faces of the surface
%
% vertex_id = the roi id of each vertex
%
% boundary_method = 'faces', 'midpoint', 'centroid', 'edge_vertices', or 
% 'edge_faces'. 'faces' will find the faces which exist between ROIs and
% those will be coloured black to specify the boundary. 'midpoint' finds 
% the edges that connect the vertices of two different ROIs and takes the
% midpoint of the edge and uses those coordinates to define the boundary. 
% 'centroid' finds the faces which exist between ROIs and uses the centroid
% of those to draw the coordinates that define the boundary. 
% 'edge_vertices' finds the vertices which define the boundary of the ROI 
% and uses them for the coordinates. 'edge_faces' finds the edges along
% faces which make up the boundary and uses them for the coordinates
%
% Outputs:
%
% BOUNDARY = the boundary of the rois. For 'faces' this will be a logical
% where a value of 1 indicates that face is on the boundary between ROIs.
% For 'midpoint', 'centroid' or 'edges', BOUNDARY will be a cell where each 
% element contains the coordinates of the points making up a boundary, 
% which can be plotted as a line. Note that each boundary defines a 
% continuous ROI, if a ROI is made up of multiple non-continuous parts 
% (i.e., the ROI is made up of multiple unconnected sections), there will 
% be a boundary for each of those parts
%
% BOUNDARY_ROI_ID = if 'midpoint' or 'centroid' is used, this will
% indicate to which roi each boundary belongs (as indicated by the 
% respective element in BOUNDARY e.g., BOUNDARY_ROI_ID(1) = 1 means
% BOUNDARY{1} defines a boundary for ROI 1, BOUNDARY_ROI_ID(2) = 1 means
% BOUNDARY{2} defines a boundary for ROI 1, BOUNDARY_ROI_ID(3) = 2 means
% BOUNDARY{3} defines a boundary for ROI 2 etc etc). BOUNDARY_ROI_ID will 
% be empty if 'faces' is used for boundary_method
%
% ROI_COMPONENTS = for each ROI, indicates how many componets make it up.
% In other words, this indicates if there are multiple nonspatially
% continuous parts to the ROI. This will only work if 'faces' is not 
% used
